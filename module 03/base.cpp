* Program: Base Class Access Specifier Examples
* 
* Description: Demonstration of how the base class access specifier works with
* inheritance in C++.  The base class access specifier works in conjunction 
* with the base class member access specifiers to determine the access 
* specification of the members in the derived class, in this code we go over 
* the different combinations with examples.

//  The base class access specifier will affect how members are inherited by the
//  derived class.  For example, when using the proteted acces specifier when 
//  inheriting the base class, the public members of the base class will become 
//  protected members of the derived class.  Generally, we use the public 
//  specifier. Notably, if no access specifier is provided the default is 
//  private.
